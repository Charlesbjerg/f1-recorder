# F1 Recorder

A simple Python script that allows me to remotely run scripts on a host device. 

An API endpoint has been setup that triggers NowTV to open and recording to start on the F1 live broadcast. This means no more waiting until 2 days later to watch the race when I miss it by an hour ðŸš€

CloudFlare tunnels are used to allow access when away from my home network.

_Disclaimer: This script has been setup to record broadcasts for my own personal use. Data recorded by this script is not redistributed in any form._
